"""Problem Description:

Given the training data, train a linear regression model and return the weights(coefficients) and w0(intercept).
Input Format:

The data is passed as a list that is to be converted to a numpy array.
Output Format:

Return the value of weights and w0 of the model.  
NOTE: All the values should be rounded up to 2 decimal places, else it might not accept the solution at run-time.
Sample Output:

[-2.13 -1.53 -0.12]   
46.46
Output Explanation:

The first line is the list of weights of the model  and the second line is the value of the w0 of the model. """

Solution:

import numpy as np
import math

#import Linear Regression class from scikit-learn library
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def coefficientsAndIntercept(xTrain, yTrain):
  # convert lists into numpy array
  X_train = np.asarray(xTrain)
  y_train = np.asarray(yTrain)
  
  # initialize linear regression
  regressor = LinearRegression()

  # fit the model
  regressor.fit(X_train,y_train)

  #return coefficients and intercepts rounded off upto 2 decimal digits
  return np.round(regressor.coef_,2),round(regressor.intercept_,2)
